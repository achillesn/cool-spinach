Poem by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Edson" target="blank">Russel Edson - </a> Film by © <a href="https://anikon.org/ " target="blank">Achilles Nasios</a>

On the other side of a mirror   
there's an inverse world,  
where the insane go sane;   
where bones climb out of the earth   
and recede to the first slime of love.

And in the evening the sun is just rising.

Lovers cry because they are a day younger,  
and soon childhood robs them of their pleasure.

In such a world there is much sadness which, of course,  
is Joy.
